> </br># ES_SQL_DDD_CQRS </br>
An effort to build a working CQRS w/ Event Store Connections and SQL database for consumable Data</br>
</br>
This is a template for a CQRS Patterned API. </br>
</br>
Steps:</br>
</br>
1) If you don't already have it, download and install Event Store @ https://eventstore.org/downloads/ and run it.</br>
</br>
2) Recommended, but not required.  A SQL management studio.</br>
</br>
3) change connection string where required to match available SQL servers (Event Store should already have all the necessary details)</br>
</br>
4) Look in the "src" folder to find example commands, events, controllers, and domain.  Replace these with necessary files and business logic.</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
TODO <br/>
Plan solutions for event streams are GUID based, or combine an ID within the Starting Event with the EventType or ...</br>
Resolve need for key planning in SQL etc...</br>
